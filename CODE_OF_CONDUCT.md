- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces—GitHub issues, pull requests, Discord/Slack channels, social media—and applies when an individual is officially representing the project.
